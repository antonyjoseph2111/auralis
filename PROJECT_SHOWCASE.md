## 🚀 The Challenge: Problem Statement SIH25216
**"Development of an Advanced Logic-Based Air Pollution Monitoring and Mitigation System for Delhi-NCR"**

Air pollution in Northern India is not just an environmental issue; it is a public health emergency. The existing infrastructure provides data but lacks:
1.  **Forecasting Accuracy:** Traditional models fail to account for complex physics and meteorological dynamics.
2.  **Source Identification:** We know *that* it is polluted, but we don't always know *where* it is coming from (stubble burning, industries, or vehicular traffic).
3.  **Actionable Insights:** Citizens need safer routes and personalized health advice, not just an AQI number.

## 💡 The Solution: Auralis

**Auralis** is a groundbreaking, integrated multi-modal system primarily designed to combat the severe air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region. We moved beyond simple monitoring to create a system that **Predicts, Identifies, and Protects**.

### 🔑 Key Innovations
*   **Physics-Aware AI:** Unlike standard "black box" models, our Hybrid BiLSTM forecasting engine is constrained by meteorological laws, ensuring 72-hour predictions are scientifically valid (~94% Accuracy).
*   **Satellite Detective:** We utilize **Sentinel-5P** satellite imagery to detect NO2 and Aerosol plumes from space, tracing them back to their exact source using reverse trajectory modeling.
*   **Pollution-Free Navigation:** An adaptive **A* Graph Algorithm** that calculates routes based on "Breathability" rather than just distance, helping cyclists and pedestrians avoid toxic hotspots.
*   **Personalized Health Shield:** Powered by **Gemini AI**, Auralis generates specific medical advisories based on a user's age and respiratory conditions (e.g., Asthma).
